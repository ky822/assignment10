First we need to quantify the list of grades of A, B, and
C, such that we can have a series of numbers. For this numbers
we can apply a 2nd polynomial regression which is more precise than
linear fit but not too complicated. And then we can use the fit to
compute the slope of the last number in the series for determining
the trend of the series. If the slope is greater than some values,
we consider it to be improving, and if the slope is less than some
values, considering it to be declining. For those whose slopes have
no significant bias, we take them to be staying the same status.
