The top 3 violations codes in NYC are 10F, 08A, and 02G, which means
"Non-food contact surface improperly constructed," "Facility not vermin proof,"
and "Cold food item held above 41F." The top 1 code is common for all the five
boroughs, and it is significantly more frequent than other codes. However, 
in Bronx, the code 04L is the 2nd frequent code, which means there is evidence
of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
Furthermore, in Staten Island we can see that the codes 10B and 06D also appear
a lot, indicating that plumbing is not properly installed or maintained and
food contact surface not properly washed. These data show that each borough
has its own local restaurant issues and problems.
