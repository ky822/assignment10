During Sep 2011 to Apr 2012, the number of restaurants graded A is increasing
rapidly. On the other hand, the number of restaurants graded B and C have
stayed stable from 2012 until now, but at the same time the number of A
is constantly growing. The trends of the five boroughs are very similar to
each others, indicating that the performance of restaurants within NYC
does not vary from borough to borough, even in staten island.
