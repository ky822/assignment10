Question 5.
It appears that overall, the grades for NYC restaurants have increased.
The overall grades for each borough have also increased.
While the number of restaurants earning A's have increased dramatically since 2011, 
the number of B's and C's have remained relatively stable since 2011.
The general shape of the distribution across time is mimicked across all boroughs. 
The number of A's (and overall activity in awarding of grades) appear to peak every 
year around May across all boroughs. Low activity points generally land in the fall months.
There was a gap in grading activity in November 2012.

Question 6.
The dataset also includes information on the reasoning behind the grades and provides
insights on which violations were triggered. This information provides insight on which
issues are most widespread in the restaurant industry in NYC, which can be useful in 
forming policies to address these issues in order of commonality to improve restaurant quality.

Grouping by the Cuisine Description, it is possible to see that perhaps restaurants
serving certain cuisine types are in need of more scrutiny in quality than others.
