Question 3: First, I set a count which is 0. Starting from the second item of the grade list, I compare the value of grade for each item in the list with the previous one. If
            the previous value of grade for the restaurant is bigger, it means the grade is not improving. Then the count plus -1. If the previous value of grade is smaller, 
            it means that the grade for the restaurant is improving. Then the count plus 1. If the value of grade doesn't change, the count remains the same. Finally, we can get 
            a count for the whole grade_list. When the final count is positive, it means the grades are improving. When the final count is negative, it means the grades are declining.
            
Question 4: The sum of grades for all restaurants is 1938.
            The sum of test_restaurant_grades for all the restaurants in MANHATTAN is 704.
            The sum of test_restaurant_grades for all the restaurants in QUEENS is 465.
            The sum of test_restaurant_grades for all the restaurants in BROOKLYN is 497.
            The sum of test_restaurant_grades for all the restaurants in STATEN ISLAND is 54.
            The sum of test_restaurant_grades for all the restaurants in BRONX is 214.

Question 5: Restaurants with grade 'A' is more than grade 'B' and 'C'. The number of restaurants with grade 'A' increased rapidly during Nov. 2010 and Nov. 2011. Generally, the grades of 
            the restaurants are improved.
            
Question 6: We can form a pie by using the CUISINE DESCRIPTION in this data to show the percentages of top 10 cuisines in NYC restaurants.Thus, we can make a guess on customers' favors.
            It seems that American, Chinese, Tea and coffee and Italian are the most popular four cuisines in NYC. Generally, I think the data is useful for assessing the quality of restaurants 
            in New York City. It contains information of restaurants with varieties of cuisines from all Boroughs in New York.
