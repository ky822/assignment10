Question 5
For either area, A was the most earned grade among restaurants and C was the lest. Also the amount of restaurants that had A_grade shows a general increasing trend and more and more dominated trend. 

Even we are evaluating more and more places through out different years, the number of restaurants getting C maintains roughly the same which indicates a improvement across the time.


Question 6
Here we are looking at 4 different graphs: most frequent cuisine type across the city and percentage of grade for top 10 (or any n numbers) cuisine type.

From the output, we can see that American was the most popular one while Chines comes as the second one. 

Even American has dominated the market, but it is not the one who has the most A grades in its own category and which in this case coffee/tea performs pretty well.

Also, Latin food has received most C_grades in his own portion compared to others.

From the above information we might focus more on why coffee/tea performs so well while latin food needs what kind of change.
