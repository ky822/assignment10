Question 5: What conclusion can you draw about the grades?

The overall grade in New York city is not so bad, since the majority of restaurants have Grade A over time.

The Grade in Manhattan has most obvious improvement over time. It seems like Manhattan also has highest proportion of 
Grade A restaurants. 

The Grade trend of Queens and Brooklyn's restaurants are pretty much the same over time. 

The Staten island seems like has less grade improvement overtime compared to other boroughs. 

The number of grade C restaurants in Bronx seems like decreasing since September 2013. We could't not conclude that Bronx has 
grade improved a lot since grade c is disappearing. It could be the cases that government shutdown a lot bad grade resturants in Bronx, which needs further investigation.



Question 6: 
What other information can you find out using this data? Is the data useful for assessing the 
quality of restaurants in New York City?

Using this data, we could also find the percentage of restaurant that has grades improved in each borough or New York City over time.
Since We have generate the total grade for each boroughs. To get the percentage of grade improved restaurants, we 
could just use the total grade,which generate by summing the test_restaurant_grades(camis_id), divided by the total number of restaurants. 

The quality of restaurants could be monitored by the percent or number of grade A restaurants over time.
However, many of the grades in the original dataset are missing, which may make the statistics drawed from the data unreliable. 
Of course, the quality here is not defined by food taste. If we need to investigate the overall quality of the restaurants
in NYC, we may need to use the restaurants reviews data such as Yep review data to draw the conclusion in more detail.
