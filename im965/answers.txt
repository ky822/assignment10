2) Justification for setting grade changes
I decided to compare the earliest and latest values in order to asses the change in the grades across time.
This approach is robust to the number of grades. Additionally, it seems like a straightforward way to handle
the resturants that have gone both up and down since the first grade was recorded. Finally, I think what people
care about most is the current grade, so it is nice that this measure incoporates this notion.

5B) What conclusion can you draw about the grades?
Both at the city level and for each of the boroughs, the number of restaurants being included in the rating files
increases a lot in the last couple of years.  The number of B's and C's (both at the city and borough) level do 
not change that much. This observation, along with the fact that not that many resturant improved their grades
(see the additional PDF file I generated, 'nyc_grade_tests.pdf) makes it clear that the new restaurants have been
getting mostly A's.

6) What other info can you find out using this data? Is it useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in NYC?
There are many different things we can inspect using this data, although there are not many informative variables,
using a little creativity we can make some neat observations. For example, I generated a plot (grade_by_type.pdf) that
presents a bar plot if the grade distribution for restaurants that are label as "Chinese" or "Italian". 
So in this example, we are able to use the data to investigate the grades profile for particular cuisine types.

Overall, the data is quite useful in assesing the quality of restaurant grade inspections, but not necessarily
the overall quality of the restaurants. There are many different way to slice and dice the data in order to ask 
different questions.  The dataset provides us with a good source of information about restuarant grades across the 
entire city and within each borough, but it does not provide much info beyond just the grades. Another avenue which
I choose not to explore is the type of violations which occur. Perhaps different types of cuisines or different boroughs
are more suceptible to a particular infraction.
