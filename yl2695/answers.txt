I thin the data is useful assessing the quality of restaurants in New York City. We can get much useful information of these restaurants. For example, we can get the trend whether a unique restaurant is imporving or not. And we can get the total scores of each inspection of a restaurant. And we can also know about how many categories of the restaurants in the city and in different borough. So I think that the data is very useful.
