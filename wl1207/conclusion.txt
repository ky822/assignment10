a highest percentage of A and a lowest percentage of C while the restaurants in BROOKLYN performs worst.

From six pie graphs for Top 8 CUISINE DESCRIPTION, we can see which types of restaurants are popular among the area.
Overall, American food is always the TOP 1 popular restaurant. Manhattan people seems more prefer Italian, Chinese,
and Japanese; while in BROOKLYN people more prefer Chinese, Caribbean and Pizza.

From our grade standard, we can see that the quality of restaurants has been imporved overtime. Restaurants in QUEENS 
have improved most, while those in STATEN ISLAND have improved least.
However, one problem in our linear regression model is that, since our total number records for each restaurant is quite 
small, the result could be sensitive. For example, different thresholds such as (0,2,-0.3),(0.3,-0.3) could lead to 
completely different conclusion. Thus, in reality, in order to get more accurate result, we should set the threshold
by past experience as well as providing more useful data for each restaurant.
