Question 6:
1. The data contains the violation descriptions of those restaurants. We can find out the major violations and warn people about those violations. Additionally, the inspectors can pay specific attentions to those major violations at next inspection. 
2. We can also use the data to find the top kinds of cuisine that have received high grades during the past years. Those top kinds of cuisine indicates people’s preference in NYC. Furthermore, we can make comparison of people’s tastes within different areas in New York State. 
3. In addition to learning people’s preference, we should also take a deeper look into the restaurants that have no inspection data. We can plot the demographic distribution of those restaurants to see if there is correlation between the location and the restaurants without inspections.
